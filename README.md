Have you ever felt unsafe while telling the front counter/cashier your personal information? Yes, we are aware that people are paying attention to personal identity security, and we would like to contribute to a safer environment where people could request qualifications without actually showing their own personal information. For example, when we go to an alcohol store, the staff asks for our personal ID and age. What if we do not want to tell the actual information but still want to show we are qualified for purchasing alcohol? In this case, OneCard provides the exact help we need.

Onecard brings the power of government ID into your smartphone. Issuer like ICBC, the City of Government will grant users their personal information. After receiving personal information from the issuer, users could pull up their cellphone to interact with the verifier. As the result, the verifier will only show the result of qualified or disqualified.

In the process, Vivian (UX Designer) and Luke (Front-end developer) has collaborated to bring One card to life. We first investigated identity safety problems in our everyday life. Then, Vivian has conducted several Secondary researches based on the social impacts of identity leaks. Luke has explored and learned the technical aspects of Microsoft Authenticater. We've learned that MS Authenticator is a great way to store one's information without concerns about data leaks. In addition, the blockchain system has provided organizations outside of Microsoft to provide their employee/members the ID with higher management and security. We've elaborated this problem to community safety. What if we could use blockchain technology to help the residents have quick access to their identity information and prevent information leak? From this perspective, we've created One Card.
